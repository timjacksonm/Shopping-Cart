## Goals:

- [✔️] Plan folder structure and component functionality I will need for this project.
- [✔️] Use react-router-dom and give your webpage atleast two pages (a homepage and a shop page).
- [✔️] Create a sticky bar which displays the number of items currently in the shopping cart.
- [✔️] Build individual card items for each of your products. Display an input field on it, which lets a user manually type in how many items they want to buy. Also add an increment and decrement button next to it for fine tuning.
- [✔️] Once a user has submitted their order, the amount of the cart itself should adjust.

**Personal Extra Credit**

- [✔️] Learn how to use TailwindCSS and use it to style your application.
- [✔️] Add a checkout page that calculates the total cost of cart.
- [✔️] Start working on your own local branch from now on and submit a pull request to be merged with origin.
