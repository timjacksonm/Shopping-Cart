## Goals:

- [‚úîÔ∏è] Plan folder structure and component functionality I will need for this project.
- [‚úîÔ∏è] Use react-router-dom and give your webpage atleast two pages (a homepage and a shop page).
- [‚úîÔ∏è] Create a sticky bar which displays the number of items currently in the shopping cart.
- [‚úîÔ∏è] Build individual card items for each of your products. Display an input field on it, which lets a user manually type in how many items they want to buy. Also add an increment and decrement button next to it for fine tuning.
- [‚úîÔ∏è] Once a user has submitted their order, the amount of the cart itself should adjust.

**Personal Extra Credit**

- [‚úîÔ∏è] Learn how to use TailwindCSS and use it to style your application.
- [‚úîÔ∏è] Add a checkout page that calculates the total cost of cart.
- [‚úîÔ∏è] Start working on your own local branch from now on and submit a pull request to be merged with origin.

## Summary

This project gave me more experience and a better understanding of how to write an application in React. The two main goals that allowed me to learn something new here was using React router and Tailwindcss. I have 4 pages total that uses react router. 3 are at the front, 1 is nested (the cart page). In retrospec I could have done a lot more pages with the router i.e. all of the items in the cart. I overall happy with how the project turned out. Tailwindcss was difficult to get started but it grew on me and I definetly could see myself using it again. As always, I tend to go the extra mile and make sure my applications are mobile responsive. I learned that tailwindcss makes this really easy! sm:code, md:code, lg:code, xl:code was so much easier than writing media queries. Timberland Tools. Small inventory currently but feel free to browse around, you just might not be strong enough for 'one' of our hammers.
